### Hi! So this has some basic functions, and... still figuring out how to turn.
anyways in Vexcode V5 Pro there are defaultly **4** main files, with their names being *vex.h*, *robot-config.h*, *robot-config.cpp*, and *main.cpp* basically I already named the files so just enable "Expert Robot Configuration" and copypaste code.
